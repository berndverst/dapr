# Dapr 1.10.8

## Fixed Dapr accepting components with impossible names in self hosted mode.

### Problem

When running in self hosted mode, Dapr would parse and accept components which
had impossible names, making them unusable.

### Impact

Impacts users running Dapr in self hosted mode.

### Root cause

Dapr was not validating the component name when running in self hosted mode.

### Solution

Added validation of the component name when running in self hosted mode.
Components with impossible names will be rejected during startup.

## Fixed an issue with service invocation path decoding

### Problem

Encoded path segments in service invocation requests (e.g.
`http://localhost:3500/v1.0/invoke/myapp/method/MyMethod%2F1`) were being
decoded by Dapr before being passed to the application. This meant the path
could be routed to the wrong app, or the app would receive a decoded path (
`MyMethod/1` in the example above) instead of the encoded path.

### Impact

Since v1.10.7, requests to service invocation endpoints with encoded path
segments may be routed to the wrong app, or the app will receive a decoded path
instead of the encoded path.

### Root cause

The Dapr HTTP server was decoding the path before passing it to the application.

### Solution

We changed the Dapr HTTP server to pass the path to the application without
decoding it.
